## Introduction
In this project, I will use my personal (IMDb) dataset with all the movies I rated. The dataset consists of 545 comma-separated-values (*.csv) file, which is available for download to anyone who has been rating movies on IMDb. 

**The goal of this project** is to better understand personal viewing habits by defining key indicators of my top-rated movies and quantifying their impact on my rating 

## Analysis

### Step 1: Visualize my viewing habits 

1. Most Watched Movie Directors 

Assumption: If I watched a lot of movies (> 2 ) for a certain director and rated it > 7, then I am more likely to enjoy other movies directed by them for the similar genre
